### I have always been a big advocate of Massive open online courses(MOOC). Over the years I have alwyas been involved in MOOCs related mostly but not limited to Computer Science. This page is a collection of my MOOC certificates and MOOC assignments that I found enjoyable and also have some visual output. My sincere gratitude to all the MOOC platforms specially to Coursera who have made learning so easy and enjoyable.
